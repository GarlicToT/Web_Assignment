                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>Hello! I am <b>Sun Rong</b>. I come from Shenzhen, and my hometown is <b>Huaihua</b>, Hunan Province, where also be the hometown of international pop star Cai Xukun. He is a Shenzhen person, too.</p>
                <p>I'm currently studying at the University of Aberdeen and South China Normal University, serving as the Head of the Liaison Development Department of the Student Union and the class rep for the 2022 AI2 class.</p>
                <p>I love participating in various school activities because it's my perfect excuse to skip courses (but <b>never skip Web Application courses</b>).</p>
                <p>In class, my role is the class rep. That is, I'm the one who notes everyone's complaints and pretends to solve them.</p>
                <p>Besides these, I enjoy trying new things, from cooking and sports to playing games—I'm always curious, but never let me be a cook, the consequence would be catastrophic.</p>
                <p>My dream is to become the <b>headmistress</b> of our university. Of course, if that doesn't work out, opening a café sounds like a good backup plan.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction.</p>
