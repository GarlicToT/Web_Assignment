                        <p>I excel at <b>sprinting</b> and even took first place in my high school sports day for the short sprint. Running fast has always been my thing! Besides sprinting, I also enjoy playing <b>badminton, soccer, and volleyball</b>. Each of these sports brings its own excitement and challenges, and they keep me active and energized. Whether it's smashing a shuttlecock in badminton, scoring a goal in soccer, or spiking the ball in volleyball, I love the thrill of competition and the camaraderie that comes with playing sports.</p>

                        <p>I used to be really into playing PUBG, but I got tired of those FPS games after a while. Now, I'm all about <b>Stardew Valley</b>. My interest in Perler beads actually came from playing this game. To be honest, Stardew Valley is a major reason why I'm having trouble finishing this web assignment. It's just so addictive!</p>

I can't get enough of her music! I've already attended five concerts from her latest <b>I AM GLORIA</b> tour. Her performances are always incredible, and I just can't wait for the next one!</p>

                        <p>Lately, I've been obsessed with <b>Perler beads</b>! These little things seem simple, but they actually require a lot of patience and creativity. Every day, I find myself wrestling with these tiny plastic beads, arranging them into all sorts of patterns, feeling like a modern-day mosaic artist. Sometimes, I lose track of time while working on them, but the sense of accomplishment when I finish a piece is totally worth it. Who knew that these little beads could bring so much color and joy into my life?</p>
